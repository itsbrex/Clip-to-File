# ClipToFile

ClipToFile is a simple Python script that allows you to save the content of your clipboard directly to a file. It is especially useful if you find yourself needing to store information that you've copied from different sources, or if you need a quick way to backup data that's currently stored in your clipboard.

This script is built with MacOS users in mind and uses AppleScript to interact with Finder for path retrieval and dialog display.

## Installation

The script relies on several Python libraries. You can install them using pip:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

You can run the script from the terminal as follows:

```
python3 clipToFile.py [-ph/--paste-here] [-f/--folder <folder_name>]
```

#### Arguments:

- `-ph` or `--paste-here`: This flag will make the script save the clipboard content to a file in the terminal's current directory without popping up a dialog box. The script will instead ask you to enter the file name directly into the terminal.

- `-f` or `--folder <folder_name>`: This optional argument allows you to specify a subfolder in the current working directory (CWD) where the file will be saved. If the specified folder doesn't exist, it will be created.

If no arguments are given, the script will pop up a dialog box asking for the file name and will save the clipboard content in the currently active Finder window's directory. If no Finder windows are open, it will save the file on the desktop.
